# Emovis 🎬

### Summery

Hi there! 👋

This is my very first project **in Swift** which I made **fully on my own**.

It is a movie guess game where you have to figure out the movie titles and only emojis are provided. 

Go ahead and gather as many points as you can! 👀


### How does it work? 🧐

*Well it is pretty easy just follow these steps:*

1. Click on the "Start Adventure button" 🚀

2. Guess your first movie 

3. Type in your answer (be careful don't use underscore: "_")

4. Click on the return/ check button or basically anywhere on the sreen

5. The background turns to green and you will hear cheering sound effect if your answer is correct. You already earned **+10 points**. (Don't worry if you did't get it, the right answer will be shown!)

6. Click on the next button to see your next task.

7. If you don't have a clue you can click on the skip button which shows you the correct answer. But your reward will be 0 point. 

8. After you guessed 10 moview the game is over. You can see your total points on the sreen. 🏆

9. Go ahead and **test your knowledge again**. 🎯
